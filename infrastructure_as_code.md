## Introduction

Infrastructure as code (IaC) tools allow you to manage infrastructure with configuration files rather than through a graphical user interface.

The document describes IaC to help manage resources.

## Summary

## Terraform

Using Terraform has several advantages over manually managing your infrastructure:
- Terraform can manage infrastructure on multiple cloud platforms.
- The human-readable configuration language helps you write infrastructure code quickly.
- Terraform's state allows you to track resource changes throughout your deployments.
- can commit your configurations to version control to safely collaborate on infrastructure.
