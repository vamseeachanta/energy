### Machine Learning

Progress a green field project in stages below:
- Descriptive
- Predictive
- Prescriptive

### Skills

Deep understanding of machine learning model development life cycles 

Extensive experience using common machine learning and deep learning libraries and techniques, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and big data platforms

Have a profound understanding of the state of the art of a multitude of fields in artificial intelligence, including but not limited to NLP, probabilistic graphical models, time-series analysis, and weak supervised learning among others


### Outlier Detection

PyOD is the most comprehensive outlier detection #python package today. It includes more than 40 detection algorithms, from classical LOF (SIGMOD 2000) to the latest ECOD (TKDE 2022)

⚙️ The authors just released a benchmark paper that covers 30 anomaly detection papers on 50 benchmark datasets, and the results are interesting! https://lnkd.in/dfd-vnw6

🎇 PyOD is well known for its unified API, variety of algorithms, and optimized performance on training & inference.

Try it out!
