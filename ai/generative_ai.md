McKinsey's AI Guide: The Economic Potential Of Generative AI From

Key takeaways from McKinsey & Company:

1. Generative AIâ€™s impact on productivity could add trillions of dollars in value to the global economy.

2. About 75 percent of the value that generative AI use cases could deliver falls across four areas: Customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and R&D.

3. Generative AI will have a significant impact across all industry sectors.

4. Generative AI has the potential to change the anatomy of work, augmenting the capabilities of individual workers by automating some of their individual activities.

5. The pace of workforce transformation is likely to accelerate, given increases in the potential for technical automation.

6. Generative AI can substantially increase labor productivity across the economy, but that will require investments to support workers as they shift work activities or change jobs.

7. The era of generative AI is just beginning
