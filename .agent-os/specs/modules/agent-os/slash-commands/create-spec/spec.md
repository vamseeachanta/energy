# Slash Command: /create-spec

> Spec: Create Spec Command with Workflow Refresh
> Created: 2025-08-04
> Status: Active
> Version: 2.0.0

## Overview

The `/create-spec` slash command creates comprehensive specifications for new features with automatic workflow refresh capabilities. This enhanced version includes continuous spec updating, execution monitoring, and learning-based improvements as default behavior for all repository specs.

## Command Syntax

```
/create-spec <module_name> <spec_description> [options]
```

### Options
- `--refresh`: Enable workflow refresh (default: true)
- `--auto-update`: Automatically update specs based on changes (default: true)
- `--learning`: Enable learning from execution (default: true)
- `--continuous`: Enable continuous execution monitoring (default: true)
- `--template <template_name>`: Use specific spec template
- `--repos <repo_list>`: Include cross-repository references

## User Stories

### Developer Creating New Feature Spec

As a developer, I want to create a spec that automatically stays synchronized with implementation changes, so that documentation remains accurate and execution follows current requirements.

**Workflow:**
1. Execute `/create-spec user-authentication "Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication"`
2. System creates spec with workflow refresh enabled by default
3. As implementation progresses, spec automatically updates
4. Execution adapts to spec changes in real-time
5. System learns from execution and suggests improvements

### Team Lead Managing Multiple Specs

As a team lead, I want specs that continuously improve based on execution results, so that our development process becomes more efficient over time.

**Workflow:**
1. Execute `/create-spec api-gateway --repos assetutilities,pyproject-starter`
2. System creates spec with cross-repository integration
3. Workflow refresh monitors all referenced repositories
4. Changes trigger automatic spec updates and re-execution
5. Learning system captures patterns and optimizes future specs

## Spec Scope

1. **Spec Creation** - Generate comprehensive specification documents
2. **Workflow Refresh** - Continuous updating and execution of specs (DEFAULT)
3. **Change Detection** - Monitor implementation and dependency changes
4. **Automatic Updates** - Apply spec updates based on detected changes
5. **Continuous Execution** - Adapt execution based on spec updates
6. **Learning System** - Capture and apply learnings from execution
7. **Cross-Repository Integration** - Monitor and integrate changes from multiple repos

## Out of Scope

- Manual-only spec management (workflow refresh is default)
- Static specifications without update capability
- One-time execution without monitoring
- Specs without learning capabilities

## Expected Deliverable

1. Functional `/create-spec` command with default workflow refresh
2. Automatic spec synchronization with implementation
3. Continuous execution with real-time adaptation
4. Learning-based spec improvements over time
5. Cross-repository change monitoring and integration

    L --> E
```

### Change Detection Triggers
1. **File System Changes** - Monitor source code modifications
2. **Dependency Updates** - Track package and library changes
3. **Documentation Updates** - Detect documentation modifications
4. **Repository Changes** - Monitor cross-repository updates
5. **Execution Results** - Learn from execution outcomes
6. **Manual Triggers** - User-initiated refresh requests

### Learning and Improvement Cycle
1. **Pattern Recognition** - Identify successful implementation patterns
2. **Failure Analysis** - Learn from execution failures
3. **Optimization Opportunities** - Discover performance improvements
4. **Best Practice Extraction** - Capture and apply best practices
5. **Knowledge Accumulation** - Build repository-specific knowledge base

## Enhanced Features with Workflow Refresh

### 1. Real-Time Spec Synchronization
```python
@slash_command("/create-spec")
def create_spec_with_refresh(module_name: str, description: str, **options):
    """Create spec with automatic workflow refresh"""
    
    # Create initial spec
    spec = create_initial_spec(module_name, description)
    
    # Enable workflow refresh by default
    refresh_config = WorkflowRefreshConfig(
        enabled=options.get('refresh', True),
        auto_update=options.get('auto_update', True),
        learning=options.get('learning', True),
        continuous=options.get('continuous', True)
    )
    
    # Setup monitoring
    monitor = SpecMonitor(spec, refresh_config)
    monitor.start()
    
    # Setup learning system
    learner = SpecLearner(spec)
    learner.initialize()
    
    # Begin continuous execution
    executor = ContinuousExecutor(spec, monitor, learner)
    executor.start()
    
    return spec
```
