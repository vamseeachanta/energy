# Execute Tasks Instructions

## Overview
This instruction set guides the systematic execution of tasks from specification documents.

## Process

### Step 1: Task Selection
- Identify tasks to execute from tasks.md
- Understand dependencies and prerequisites
- Confirm task scope and requirements

### Step 2: Implementation Planning
- Create detailed implementation plan
- Identify required resources and tools
- Plan testing and validation approach

### Step 3: Development Execution
- Follow test-driven development (TDD) approach
- Implement functionality systematically
- Maintain code quality standards

### Step 4: Testing and Validation
- Run comprehensive test suite
- Validate functionality against requirements
- Ensure no regressions introduced

### Step 5: Documentation and Completion
- Update relevant documentation
- Mark tasks as completed
- Commit changes with descriptive messages

## Standards to Follow
- Adhere to code style guidelines in .agent-os/standards/
- Follow best practices for the technology stack
- Maintain consistent patterns with existing codebase
- Write comprehensive tests for new functionality

## Task Status Management
- Use clear status indicators: [ ], [x], [⚠️]
- Update tasks.md immediately after completion
- Document any blocking issues encountered
- Communicate progress and dependencies

This ensures systematic and quality-focused task execution.
