# Execute Tasks Instructions

## Overview
This instruction set guides the systematic execution of tasks from specification documents.

## Process

### Step 1: Task Selection
- Identify tasks to execute from tasks.md
- Understand dependencies and prerequisites
- Confirm task scope and requirements

### Step 2: Implementation Planning
- Create detailed implementation plan
- Identify required resources and tools
- Plan testing and validation approach

### Step 3: Development Execution
- Follow test-driven development (TDD) approach
- Implement functionality systematically
- Maintain code quality standards

### Step 4: Testing and Validation
- Run comprehensive test suite
- Validate functionality against requirements
- Ensure no regressions introduced

### Step 5: Documentation and Completion
- Update relevant documentation
- Mark tasks as completed
- Commit changes with descriptive messages

## Standards to Follow
- Adhere to code style guidelines in .agent-os/standards/
- Follow best practices for the technology stack
- Maintain consistent patterns with existing codebase
- Write comprehensive tests for new functionality

## Task Status Management
- Use clear status indicators: [ ], [x], [⚠️]
- Update tasks.md immediately after completion
- Document any blocking issues encountered
- Communicate progress and dependencies

This ensures systematic and quality-focused task execution.

  <enhances>agents with task experience</enhances>
  <tracks>common and variation context</tracks>
  <improves>agent performance over time</improves>
</step_metadata>

<learning_system>
  **MANDATORY**: With every task executed, participating agents are enhanced with:
  
  1. **Common Context** - Patterns that work across all tasks
     - Successful implementation patterns
     - Best practices discovered
     - Optimization techniques
     - Error recovery strategies
  
  2. **Variation Context** - Task-specific learnings
     - Domain-specific patterns
     - Technology-specific approaches
     - Complexity-based strategies
     - Performance optimizations
  
  3. **Continuous Improvement**
     - Agents get better with every project
     - Knowledge shared across agents
     - Performance metrics tracked
     - Learning level progression
</learning_system>

<agent_progression>
  Learning Levels:
  - **Novice** (0-10 tasks): Following standard practices
  - **Intermediate** (11-50 tasks): Applying learned patterns
  - **Advanced** (51-200 tasks): Optimizing with experience
  - **Expert** (200+ tasks): Leading with best practices
  - **Master** (500+ tasks, >90% success): Innovation and optimization
</agent_progression>

<knowledge_accumulation>
  Each task contributes to:
  - Pattern recognition database
  - Success factor analysis
  - Error prevention knowledge
  - Optimization techniques
  - Domain expertise growth
</knowledge_accumulation>

<cross_agent_learning>
  Successful patterns are shared:
  - Best practices propagated to all agents
  - Collective intelligence grows
  - Anti-patterns identified and avoided
  - Global optimization strategies emerge
</cross_agent_learning>

<performance_tracking>
  Metrics tracked for improvement:
  - Success rate over time
  - Efficiency improvements
  - Quality score trends
  - Learning rate calculation
  - Domain expertise levels
</performance_tracking>

<instructions>
  ACTION: Extract learning from every completed task
  UPDATE: Agent knowledge bases with new patterns
  SHARE: Successful strategies across all agents
  TRACK: Performance improvements over time
  REPORT: Learning progress and recommendations
</instructions>

### Step 0: Initialize Progress Tracking

<step_metadata>
  <initializes>real-time progress tracking</initializes>
  <displays>visual task overview</displays>
  <updates>all spec documents</updates>
</step_metadata>

<progress_system>
  **MANDATORY**: All task execution includes:
  
  1. **Visual Progress Display**
     - Clear on-screen task status
     - Progress bars with percentages
     - Milestone celebrations
     - Time estimates
  
  2. **Automatic Updates**
     - tasks.md updated after each subtask
     - progress.md with detailed tracking
     - spec.md annotated with notes
     - AI prompts/responses logged
  
  3. **Session Continuity**
     - Resume from interruption point
     - Persistent progress tracking
     - Historical metrics
</progress_system>

<display_format>
  Before proceeding with each task:
  - SHOW current progress overview
  - DISPLAY completed vs remaining
  - UPDATE visual progress bar
  - LOG AI decisions
</display_format>

<instructions>
  ACTION: Initialize progress tracking
  DISPLAY: Visual task overview
  UPDATE: All documents in real-time
  TRACK: Every AI interaction
  CELEBRATE: Milestones achieved
</instructions>
