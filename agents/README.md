# AI Agents Library

This folder contains specialized AI agents for various development tasks.
Agents are sourced from AITmpl and Claude Code Templates.

## Folder Structure

```

â”œâ”€â”€ security/          # Security audit and penetration testing
â”œâ”€â”€ performance/       # Performance optimization agents
â”œâ”€â”€ testing/          # Test generation and E2E testing
â”œâ”€â”€ documentation/    # API and code documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ devops/          # CI/CD and infrastructure
â”œâ”€â”€ data/            # Data engineering and ETL
â””â”€â”€ code_quality/    # Code review and refactoring
```

## Usage

### Automatic Agent Selection

Agents are automatically selected based on your current task:

```bash
# During spec creation
/spec create api-gateway  # Automatically uses API Security Agent

# During testing
/test generate  # Uses Test Generation Agent

# During optimization
/project optimize  # Uses Performance Optimization Agents
```

### Manual Agent Usage

```bash
# List all available agents
/ai-agent list

# Get recommendations for current context
/ai-agent recommend

# Use specific agent
/ai-agent use "API Security Audit Agent"

# Get agent information
/ai-agent info "Test Generation Agent"
```

## Integration Points

Agents integrate with these commands:
- `/spec create` - Automatic agent recommendations
- `/task execute` - Agent assistance during implementation
- `/test run` - Testing agents for quality assurance
- `/project optimize` - Performance agents
- `/git commit` - Code review agents

## Best Practices

1. **Let agents recommend themselves** - The system knows which agents to use
2. **Chain agents for better results** - Use multiple agents in sequence
3. **Review agent suggestions** - Don't apply blindly
4. **Customize for your project** - Adapt agent outputs to your standards
5. **Share improvements** - Contribute agent enhancements back

## Adding Custom Agents

To add your own agents:

1. Create agent file in appropriate category folder
2. Follow the agent template structure
3. Update this README with agent details
4. Test agent integration
