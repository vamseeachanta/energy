# Introduction

For general guidance on building a library, see [py package](https://github.com/vamseeachanta/py_package)

# Guidelines

- If new library, ensure the proposed name does exists for use on pypi.org prior to development. This foresight will help avoid refactoring
- ?





## Pipeline Summary

a/ Needed: Get library to run
b/ Needed: Add tests as a batch file
c/ Needed: Add usage instructions
c/ Nice to have: bring tests to root folder ?. Refer to python standard libraries (numpy, openfast etc.)
d/ Needed: add results to ui
e/ Needed: prepare demo gifs or videos
