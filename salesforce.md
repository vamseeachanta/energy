Queue based vs. Skill based

### Omni channel queue architecture

Insert (new) case:
- Case is created
- Assigned to queue (Omni)

- Multiple agents. 
    - Based on status, availability, capacity based workload etc. on the Omnichannel. Based on configuration, case is assigned to a single agent

- If case update (i.e existing case ) scenario:
    - Status updated to need additional information
    - Route to special information group
    - owner should be changed to different queue. This will be another omnichannel queue
    - repeat architecture.
