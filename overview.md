## Introduction
The document describes the python energy initiatives for the following:
- Data
    - Objective is to create a energy_data python library
    - The objective is to get open source data available. Starting source is bsee data. 
    - Identify other data packages and guide to them via dependency package
    - engineering integrity of the data along with engineering units etc.

- Analysis 
    - Objective is to create a energy_analysis python library
    - implement industry standard codes (API, ISO, DNV, ABS etc.) for easy use and analysis

## Summary

Typically, the data analysis intiatives do not care about data. The data initiatives may not comprehensively think or understand how the data is used. The good practices to be used are summarized in below documents:

- Python principles to be used
- data principles to be used
- analysis principles to be used


## Project guidelines
- for python principles, see python.md 
- for data principles, see tba
- for analysis principles, see tba
