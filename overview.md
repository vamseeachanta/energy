## Introduction
The document describes the python energy initiatives for the following:
- Data
    - Objective is to create a energy_data python library
    - The objective is to get open source data available. Starting source is bsee data. 
    - Identify other data packages and guide to them via dependency package
    - engineering integrity of the data along with engineering units etc.

- Analysis 
    - Objective is to create a energy_analysis python library
    - implement industry standard codes (API, ISO, DNV, ABS etc.) for easy use and analysis

## Summary

Typically, the data analysis intiatives do not care about data. The data initiatives may not comprehensively think or understand how the data is used. The good practices to be used are summarized in below documents:

- Python principles to be used
- data principles to be used
- analysis principles to be used


## Project guidelines
- for python principles, see python.md 
- for data principles, see tba
- for analysis principles, see tba

## Drilling Automation

We in the Drilling System Automation Technical Section (DSATS) have had a successful run of some 13.5 years, but we think it is time to refresh things a bit, as the industry/state-of-the-art has moved in Drilling Automation. So we are looking for volunteers, especially from Young Professional and/or those who have not yet participated in DSATS, to join in the “DSATS V2 Committee”, who will be drafting an abstract outline of a revised DSATS “Mission and Vision” and nominating a slate of new Officers and Board members. The timing of this is to be able to report out to the DSATS membership at the DSATS/IADC ART Symposium the day before the Drilling Conference in early March.

Can you send me your current email address to mark.anderson@ensignenergy.com.
