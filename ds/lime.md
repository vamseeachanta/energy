## Introduction


LIME assumes a black box machine learning model and investigates the relationship between input and output, represented by the model.

Conduct feature (or data or other parameter) sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of input variations on output

Limitation: LIME handles linear relationship very well but fails when non-linearity exists
