## Introduction





## Summary

Hypothesis testing is one of the most central things in statistics learning. The tricky part is there are many cases we need to consider, and handle differently. A nice chart for a quick look up.

Also, some other fundamentals of statistics will help you to have a quick start in ML study:

Full understanding of
- Hypothesis testing framework, e.g. p-values, conclusions, Type I and Type II error
- Confidence interval framework

Basic understanding of 
- Probability calculations, especially Bayes rule/ conditional probability and the Central Limit Theorem
- Distributions, including properties of random variables 

Full understanding of the models you use:
- Assumptions of tests, and how bias could affect results
- Confounding variables and Simpson's Paradox
