## Introduction

Digital Transformation is the digital technologies and the data analytics associated with it:


## SUmmary

- Digital is more than the technolog. It is the tranformation of the workforce, constomers and their stakeholders.
- Customer service is the heart of digital transformation. Digital transformation starts and ends with the customer


## Digital Transformation

Why digital transformation:
- Enhance data collection
- Greater resource management
- Data driven customer insights
- Improve customer experience
- Encourage digital culture
- Increase profits
- Increase agility
- Improve productivity


Data exhaust vs. digital connections

Data Exhaust: The kind of data collected over the course of a process or service


## Digital Technologies

- Moble 4G -> 5G
- Cloud computing
- AI and ML (Data analytics)
- IoT (Internet of Things)
- Blockchain
- Digital Twin
- Artificial Reality
- Social Media (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn)
- Robotics and additive manufacturing


## Customer Centric Approach

75% of customers love it when:
- A company recognizes their name
- Know their purchase history
- Recommend products based on their past purchases

To get through successful digital transformation:
- Need a digital ecosystem spanning across departments, customers, suppliers etc.
- digital first mindset
- Focus on great customer digital experience


## How to assess an organization for digital transformation

Key aspects are:
- The people/workforce 
    - Are the employees trained to use the digital technologies
    - Are they motivated to use the digital technologies
    - Are the digital technologies augmenting the knowledge, skills and abilities of your employees
- The processes in use. The ongoing programs and projects (3Ps)
    - Are the processes are optimized i.e. no duplicates, 
    - Agility of projects and processes
    - Measurement of efficiency and effectiveness of 3Ps (Think of data exhaust)
    - Reassess the 3Ps for efficiency and effectiveness by measurement
- The current (and future) state of technology
    - What digital technologies is the organization currently using
    - digital technologies to be adopted in future
    - what are the strategic rationales for adopting digital technologies i.e. the cost and the associated benefits
- The customers now and would-be customers after digital transformation:
    - what are the "jobs to be done" for the customers
    - How do the digital transformation help you learn about the customers?
    - Are the digital technologies helping you serve your customers better
    - How do you know you are serving the customers better?

### Organization Dynamic Capabilities

- Strategy matters most in the times of change. 
- Firms must develop "Dynamic capabilities to create, extend and modify the ways in which they make their living.
- A capability is the ability to perform a particular task or activity
- Operational capabilities enable an organization to earn a living in the present
- In contrast, dynamic capabilities are change related. A dynamic capability is the capacity of a firm to purposfully create, extend and modify its resource base
- Resource base includes tangible, intangible, human assets, capabilities (eg. patents, trademarks, people, resources, etc.)
- digital dynamic capabilities is related to data (flexibility)
- In a fast changing environment, as things evolve, the dynamic capabilities become operational capabilities and we have evolve and innovate more dynamic capabilities
- So, reassessing the dynamic capabilities will help keep digital transformation fresh and competitive for the organization

Finding dynamic capabilities of an organization:
- Look in the resource base (look for those not used or underutilized)
- Digital transformation may involve adding a capability or tweaking to make it better (i.e. transform operation capabilities into dynamic capabilities)
- Build these dynamic capabilities in response to market needs, competition or new regulatory environment

Building Dynamic Capabilities is a 3 step process: Sense, Sieze and transform
- THe key triggers for dynamic capabilities are:
    - disruptive digital competitors
    - changing customer behaviors
    - disruptive digital technologies
- digital sensing
    - digital scouting
    - digital scenario planning
    - digital mindset crafting
- digital siezing
    - rapid prototyping
    - balancing digital portfolios
    - strategic aglity (retooling)
- digital transformation
    - navigating the innovation ecosystems
    - redesigning internal structures (better communication, better dataflows)
    - improve digital maturity (from prototype to fully operational stages)

Building Networks of dynamic capabilities helps increase the power. On their own they are powerful but when linking together, they can be synergistic and extemely powerful. 
Benefits of dynamic capabilities networks:
- accelerate information and knowledge flow
- Get the right people on the bus in the right direction
- Increase velocity of knowledge
- maximize serendipity
Make sense of large amounts of information:
- Build better and bigger sensors
- Seperate wheat from chaff (i.e. good data from useless data)
- find the weak signals
- Map the domain ecosystem
Robust analytics infrastructure to generate insights and actions
- find hidden information and knowledge
- improve the speed of decision making
- support critical initiatives
Improves competency landscape:
- develop new competencies
- make useable knowledge throughout the organization
- continually refine and connect competencies

A dynamic capabilities case study of an International Oil company (IOC):
- Create oil demand scenarios to 2050
- inventory resource base, operatonal capabilities and dynamic capabilities
- THe IOC planning team goes through sensing, sizing and transform process to develop a list of ten dynamic capabilites
- Created a Global Capability Team (GCT) is created to evaluate the effectivness of the dynamic capabilities. These capabilities are incorporated into the annual strategic planning
- Three dynamic capabilities for year 1:
    - accurate volume and risk predictions in investment proposals (i.e. exploration stage)
    - Ability to orchestrate the human resources (i.e. recruit, train and deploy talent) in the right places
    - Ability of leaders to manage the centralized-decentralized polarity. Entrust managers in the ventures with managerial and operational decisions while also protecting the need for core organization priciples on communication, cross-venture collaboration, HSSE, quality, efficiency and effectiveness
- Key lessons:
    - dynamic capabilities needed (managerial) orchestartion to truly realize the value
    - dynamic capabilities are identified through strategic assessment
    - dynamic capabilities were relevant throughout the strategy development and execution process


### Fitness Landscape

BUilding an NK Fitness landscape
- N = Capabilities (eg. )
- A = states of each capabilities
- K = interactions betweeen capabiltiies
- THe number of scenarious are A^N and the fintess associated with each scenario is evaluated.
- When doing a fitness landscape simulation, we will find a simple to chaotic scenarious. 
- However, a rugged landscape is always an easily available possibility
- The best way to navigate this is to get on the easiest peak. From this peak, sketch and plan for the next highest peak and so on till we reach maximum potential.
