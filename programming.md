## Introduction
The document describes the programming principles to be the followed for typical programming projects:

## Summary

- follow guidelines as a good samaritan, [good_samaritan_guidelines.md](good_samaritan_guidelines.md)

## 3 month Training for Fresh Grads

### Weeks 1,2

- Learn common programming principles
  - Object oriented programming principles (see section below)
  - SOLID programming principles (see below)
  - Learn test driven development principles
- Read book : 
  - [REF-IT-Clean_Code.pdf](https://github.com/vamseeachanta/energy/blob/master/it/REF-IT-Clean_Code.pdf). 
  - read chapters 1 to 3 in first 2 weeks of training.
  - Reread chapters 1 to 3 and read chapters 4 to 10 in first 5 weeks of training.
- Why are environments (or sandboxes) important. Learn to create environments.
- Follow good repo guidelines (see below)

- Provide daily updates by updating the daily_update_template.md in your own repository. Example [daily_update_template.md](pm\daily_update_template.md)
- Review daily checklist:
  - update checklist status daily. Example [checklist.md](pm\checklist.md)
  - review for any newly added items

- create github account and share with leaders. [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)
  - share repo with mentors as collaborators

- install VS code
  - see [https://github.com/vamseeachanta/energy/blob/master/ide_vscode.md](https://github.com/vamseeachanta/energy/blob/master/ide_vscode.md)
 
- Git work
  - follow instructions in : [tools\git.md](tools\git.md) to:
    - Install git
    - create a new branch, 'training'
    - continue working in this new branch
    - push code every day before review call
  - perform git operations from vs code. See below for reference.

- Resource Requirements

  - Need to get a PC prior to start of training program
    - document pc specs (processor, ram, hard disk space etc.) on github
  - Need good broadband internet connection to be able to connect to a computer in US
    - document speed test results in ascii format using link [https://speed.measurementlab.net/#/](https://speed.measurementlab.net/#/)


- write code to demonstrate above learnings:
  - use most comfortable language of choice. Training language will be decided in 1 week
  - use ide of choice.  
    - VS Code will be extensively used for training and work. 
    - see [https://github.com/vamseeachanta/energy/blob/master/ide_vscode.md](https://github.com/vamseeachanta/energy/blob/master/ide_vscode.md)
  - Commit to github in your training repo. Share the repo with leaders.
  - create documentation using markdown (.md) files. 
- use other resources to learn and code as needed

- Provide daily updates using daily_update_template, [daily_update_template](https://github.com/vamseeachanta/energy/blob/master/scrum/daily_update_template.md)

### Weeks 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Technology training (2 months)
    - set-up VS Code as working IDE 
    - follow a prescribed training program in a technology

### Weeks 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
- project work (1 month)
  - 30 point project
  - 6-8 user stories

## OOPs

A simple explanation for object oriented programming principles is given below:
