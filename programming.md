## Introduction
The document describes the programming principles to be the followed for typical programming projects:

## Summary
- TBA

## 3 month Training

- create github account and share with leaders. [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)
- Resource Requirements
  - Need to get a PC prior to hire date
    - document pc specs (processor, ram, hard disk space etc.) on github
  - Need good broadband internet connection to be able to connect to a computer in US
    - document speed test results in ascii format using link [https://speed.measurementlab.net/#/](https://speed.measurementlab.net/#/)

- Learn common programming principles (1 week)
- Object oriented programming principles (see section below)
- SOLID programming principles (see below)

- write code to demonstrate above learnings:
  - use most comfortable language of choice. Training language will be decided in 1 week
  - use ide of choice.  
    - VS Code will be extensively used for training and work. 
    - see [https://github.com/vamseeachanta/energy/blob/master/ide_vscode.md](https://github.com/vamseeachanta/energy/blob/master/ide_vscode.md)
  - Commit to github in your training repo. Share the repo with leaders.
  - create documentation using markdown (.md) files. 
- use other resources to learn and code as needed
- Recommended book to read: 
  - [REF-IT-Clean_Code.pdf](https://github.com/vamseeachanta/energy/blob/master/it/REF-IT-Clean_Code.pdf). 
  - read chapters 1 to 10 in first 3 weeks of training.

- Provide daily updates using daily_update_template, [daily_update_template](https://github.com/vamseeachanta/energy/blob/master/scrum/daily_update_template.md)

- Technology training (2 months)
    - set-up VS Code as IDE
    - follow a prescribed training program

- project work (1 month)
  - 30 point project
  - 6-8 user stories
