# JIT Compilation



##	Summary

Numba 
Cython
Pyjion

## Numba

Numba needs compatible variables to run the code and keep it compiled for repeat usage. 
Numba warmed up code can be reused to save time from 2nd run onwards

Key unknowns:
- can we deploy numba compiled code to run fast the first time?
- a decorator function Find variables that are numba compilation compatible?

## Usecases
