Good Practices:
- Be kind.  Everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about.
- When you choose to see the good in others, you end up finding the good in yourself.
- We learn by helping others.
- Hard work and dedication still get recognized (irrespective of race, gender, or age)

### Writing

- Write to thinl. If you are an expert in your area, writing will help you consolidate things.
- Writing to think is different from writing for readers (effects: intereference, do not understand or skip, slow-down to re-read, agrravation and stop etc.)

### Habits

For my 32nd birthday, I asked several 90-year-olds what advice they would give to their 32-year-old selves.

Here are 30 pieces of life advice everyone needs to hear:

1. Now and then, break out the fancy china and drink the good wine for no reason at all.
2. Dance at weddings until your feet are sore.
3. Tell your partner you love them every night before falling asleep. Someday you’ll find the other side of the bed empty and wish you could.
4. Don’t fear sadness, as it tends to sit right next to love.
5. Treat your body like a house you have to live in for another 70 years.
6. Never raise your voice, except for at a ballgame.
7. Do one good deed every single day, but never tell anyone about it.
8. Time doesn't heal anything when it comes to relationships. Don't delay difficult conversations.
9. Find the things that make your eyes light up. Do more of those.
10. Always remind yourself that your track record for making it through your bad days is perfect.
11. If something has a minor issue, repair it. Minor issues become major issues over time. Applies equally to love, friendships, health, and home.
12. The most damning lie you can tell is the lie you tell to yourself.
13. No one has ever argued their way to happiness.
14. If you’re going to lose a fight, make sure the other person thinks twice before fighting you again.
15. Getting old is no picnic, but it's much better than the alternative.
16. You may occasionally disappoint others, but make sure to never disappoint yourself.
17. Never let a good friendship atrophy. Send the text, make the call, plan the trip. Good friendships must be treasured.
18. When you meet someone, look them in the eye, give a firm handshake, and call them by their name.
19. Give everybody a second chance, but never a third.
20. The "good old days" are always happening right now.
21. Whenever you hug someone, make sure they are the one to let go first.
22. If it's raining on a warm summer evening, go outside and dance in it.
23. Taking no risk is the biggest risk you can take. Regret from inaction is always more painful than regret from action.
24. It doesn’t have to be perfect for it to be wonderful.
25. Stop trying to change people who don’t want to be changed.
26. Looking presentable is a matter of self-respect.
27. When you’re feeling down, smile at yourself in the mirror for a full minute.
28. Travel as much as you can. Collect one token from every trip to remember it by.
29. If there's something bothering you, ask yourself whether it will matter in one month. If not, let it go right now.
30. When in doubt, love. We can always use more love.
