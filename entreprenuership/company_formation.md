## Introduction

Key requirements and things to consider for forming a company.

### Key requirements

- Company name
    - Typically goes with what is available. 
    - Other consideration is to have a website that matches the name. These days, in addition to .com, .org, people are considering .io as extensions thus expanding possibilities (and also confusion)
- State in which to form the company. 
    - Most states need need a residence address (or) PO box in that state
    - Easier to form a company in the state of residence. 
- Decide the type of incorporation
    - Form an inc to keep a firewall between personal and company
