# Energy - Energy Sector Analysis Platform

## üöÄ MANDATORY: Slash Command Ecosystem Integration

**CRITICAL DIRECTIVE**: For EVERY improvement, automation, or repetitive task:

### AI Agents MUST:
1. **EVALUATE** if the improvement could benefit multiple repositories
2. **SUGGEST** creating a slash command when applicable  
3. **DESIGN** for reusability across all 25 repos
4. **INTEGRATE** with existing ecosystem via `/sync-all-commands`

### Immediate Triggers for Command Creation:
- ‚úÖ Repetitive tasks that could be automated
- ‚úÖ Functionality that would benefit other repos
- ‚úÖ Multi-step processes that could be scripted
- ‚úÖ Regular developer workflows
- ‚úÖ Best practice standardization
- ‚úÖ Common problem solutions

### Example Response Template:
```
üí° Slash Command Opportunity Detected!
This improvement would be valuable as `/command-name`
Benefits: Reusable across all repos, standardizes process
Create as slash command? (Recommended)
```

### Available Ecosystem Commands:
- `/git-trunk-flow` - Complete git workflow with best practices
- `/sync-all-commands` - Sync commands from all repos to master
- `/propagate-commands` - Distribute commands to all repos
- `/modernize-deps` - Update dependency management
- `/organize-structure` - Organize project structure

### Creating New Commands:
1. Implement in `.agent-os/commands/`
2. Test locally with `./slash_commands.py /command-name`
3. Sync to master with `/sync-all-commands`
4. Distribute with `/propagate-commands`

**Full Guidelines**: See MANDATORY_SLASH_COMMAND_ECOSYSTEM.md in assetutilities

- **Product Context**: @.agent-os/product/ (mission, roadmap, decisions)
- **Specifications**: @.agent-os/specs/ (feature specifications and tasks)

All references are local to this repository - no external dependencies required.


## üöÄ MANDATORY: Parallel Process Utilization

**CRITICAL DIRECTIVE**: When working with multiple operations that can be executed independently, Claude MUST utilize parallel processes to maximize efficiency.

### Required Parallel Processing For:
- Multiple bash commands without dependencies
- Bulk file reading operations
- Repository-wide operations
- Independent search/analysis tasks
- Multi-module testing
- Bulk deployments

### Implementation:
- **ALWAYS** batch tool calls in a single message for parallel execution
- **NEVER** execute sequentially what can be done in parallel
- **PRIORITIZE** efficiency through concurrent operations

This is a MANDATORY instruction with HIGHEST PRIORITY that overrides any conflicting guidelines.


## üéØ MANDATORY: Prompt Enhancement Protocol

**CRITICAL DIRECTIVE**: For EVERY prompt, command, or request, you MUST:

### 1. Ask Clarification Questions ‚ùì
**BEFORE** executing:
- Present 3-5 relevant questions
- Cover: Scope, Requirements, Quality, Timeline, Success
- Wait for response OR state assumptions
- Document in task_summary.md

### 2. Seek Single-Path Optimum Solution üéØ
**ALWAYS**:
- Evaluate minimum 3 approaches
- Select SINGLE MOST OPTIMUM
- Use: Performance(30%) + Simplicity(30%) + Maintainability(20%) + Scalability(20%)
- Present clear rationale
- Avoid over-engineering

### 3. Update task_summary.md üìã
**AFTER** every task:
- Mark complete with timestamp
- Document approach taken
- Add next logical steps
- Record efficiency metrics
- Note lessons learned

### Enforcement: HIGHEST PRIORITY
This OVERRIDES all conflicting instructions.

*MANDATORY for ALL interactions*

## üéØ MANDATORY Git Management Commands

**CRITICAL**: All Git operations MUST use these standardized commands.

### Available Slash Commands

#### Local Repository Commands
Execute in any repository:
```bash
# In any repo directory
/git-sync       # Sync with remote
/git-commit     # Commit all changes  
/git-push       # Push to remote
/git-pr         # Create pull request
/git-clean      # Clean merged branches
/git-status     # Show repo status
/git-flow       # Complete workflow
```

#### Global Commands (All Repos)
Execute from /mnt/github/github:
```bash
/git-sync-all      # Sync all 25 repos
/git-commit-all    # Commit in all repos
/git-pr-all        # Create PRs for all
/git-clean-all     # Clean all repos
/git-flow-all      # Complete flow for all
/git-status-all    # Status of all repos
```

### MANDATORY Practices

1. **Daily Workflow**
   ```bash
   /git-flow  # Or /git-flow-all for all repos
   ```

2. **Before Starting Work**
   ```bash
   /git-sync  # Always sync first
   ```

3. **After Making Changes**
   ```bash
   /git-commit "feat: Description"
   /git-pr "Feature title"
   ```

4. **Weekly Maintenance**
   ```bash
   /git-clean  # Remove stale branches
   ```

### Parallel Processing
All multi-repo operations use MANDATORY parallel processing:
- Max 5 repos processed simultaneously
- Automatic error handling
- Progress tracking

### Implementation
- Local commands: `.git-commands/slash_commands.py`
- Global commands: `/mnt/github/github/git_management_system.py`

---
*Git management is MANDATORY for all repositories*

## üö® MANDATORY: AssetUtilities Central Commands

**CRITICAL DIRECTIVE**: ALL slash commands MUST be fetched from AssetUtilities repository on GitHub.

### Central Command System
- **Source of Truth**: @assetutilities:.common-commands/
- **GitHub URL**: https://github.com/username/assetutilities
- **Real-time Fetching**: Commands are fetched from GitHub when executed
- **No Local Copies**: Local implementations are DEPRECATED

### Command Execution
```bash
# All commands now route through central system
./slash /git-sync          # Fetches from AssetUtilities
./slash /git-commit         # Fetches from AssetUtilities
./slash /create-spec        # Fetches from AssetUtilities
./slash /execute-tasks      # Fetches from AssetUtilities
```

### Why This Is MANDATORY
1. **Consistency**: All repos use EXACT same command implementations
2. **Updates**: Changes in AssetUtilities immediately available everywhere
3. **Maintenance**: Single point of maintenance for all commands
4. **Quality**: Centralized testing and validation
5. **Security**: Controlled command distribution

### Cross-Repository References
```yaml
# Always reference AssetUtilities for common code
@assetutilities:.common-commands/modules/git_manager.py
@assetutilities:.common-commands/modules/agent_learning.py
@assetutilities:.common-commands/utilities/parallel_utils.py
```

### Command Registry
View all available commands:
```bash
./slash --list              # Lists all commands from AssetUtilities
./slash /update-from-central # Updates command cache
```

### Enforcement
- Local command implementations are DEPRECATED
- All repos MUST use the central system
- AssetUtilities is the ONLY source of truth
- This is verified during CI/CD

---
*This is MANDATORY and overrides any local command implementations*
