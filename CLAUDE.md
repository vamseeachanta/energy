## Workflow Instructions

When asked to work on this codebase:

1. **First**, understand the energy industry context and regulatory environment
2. **Then**, follow the appropriate instruction file:
   - For new features: @.agent-os/instructions/create-spec.md
   - For tasks execution: @.agent-os/instructions/execute-tasks.md
3. **Always**, consider regulatory compliance and industry standards

## Enhanced Features Available

This project supports enhanced Agent OS workflows including:
- **Enhanced Spec Creation**: Prompt summaries, executive summaries, mermaid diagrams, module organization
- **Cross-Repository Integration**: Shared components from AssetUtilities hub (@assetutilities: references)

- **Template Variants**: minimal, standard, enhanced, api_focused, research
- **Visual Documentation**: Auto-generated system architecture and workflow diagrams

### Command Examples
```bash
# Enhanced spec creation
/create-spec feature-name module-name enhanced

# Traditional spec creation (backward compatible)  
/create-spec feature-name

# Enhanced task execution with summaries
/execute-tasks @specs/modules/module-name/spec-folder/tasks.md
```

## Available Commands

- **Create-Module-Agent:** Available via `/create-module-agent` command



### Enhanced Create-Spec Command

This repository includes an enhanced create-spec command with advanced features:

```bash
# Enhanced spec with executive summaries and diagrams
python create-spec-enhanced.py feature-name module-name enhanced

# Research-focused specification
python create-spec-enhanced.py research-topic research

# Quick minimal specification
python create-spec-enhanced.py quick-fix minimal
```

Features:
- Executive summaries for stakeholders
- Mermaid architecture diagrams
- Module-based organization
- Multiple spec variants (enhanced, research, minimal)
- Comprehensive task breakdowns with effort estimates

## Self-Contained Agent OS

This repository includes a complete, self-contained Agent OS framework. All slash commands work immediately after `git clone` with no additional setup required.

### Available Slash Commands
- `/create-spec <spec-name>` - Create detailed specification documents
- `/execute-tasks <tasks-file>` - Execute tasks from specification
- `/create-module-agent <agent-name>` - Create specialized AI agents

### Local Agent OS Structure
- **Standards**: @.agent-os/standards/ (code style, best practices)
- **Instructions**: @.agent-os/instructions/ (workflow guidance)
- **Product Context**: @.agent-os/product/ (mission, roadmap, decisions)
- **Specifications**: @.agent-os/specs/ (feature specifications and tasks)

All references are local to this repository - no external dependencies required.


## üöÄ MANDATORY: Parallel Process Utilization

**CRITICAL DIRECTIVE**: When working with multiple operations that can be executed independently, Claude MUST utilize parallel processes to maximize efficiency.

### Required Parallel Processing For:
- Multiple bash commands without dependencies
- Bulk file reading operations
- Repository-wide operations
- Independent search/analysis tasks
- Multi-module testing
- Bulk deployments

### Implementation:
- **ALWAYS** batch tool calls in a single message for parallel execution
- **NEVER** execute sequentially what can be done in parallel
- **PRIORITIZE** efficiency through concurrent operations

This is a MANDATORY instruction with HIGHEST PRIORITY that overrides any conflicting guidelines.


## üéØ MANDATORY: Prompt Enhancement Protocol

**CRITICAL DIRECTIVE**: For EVERY prompt, command, or request, you MUST:

### 1. Ask Clarification Questions ‚ùì
**BEFORE** executing:
- Present 3-5 relevant questions
- Cover: Scope, Requirements, Quality, Timeline, Success
- Wait for response OR state assumptions
- Document in task_summary.md

### 2. Seek Single-Path Optimum Solution üéØ
**ALWAYS**:
- Evaluate minimum 3 approaches
- Select SINGLE MOST OPTIMUM
- Use: Performance(30%) + Simplicity(30%) + Maintainability(20%) + Scalability(20%)
- Present clear rationale
- Avoid over-engineering

### 3. Update task_summary.md üìã
**AFTER** every task:
- Mark complete with timestamp
- Document approach taken
- Add next logical steps
- Record efficiency metrics
- Note lessons learned

### Enforcement: HIGHEST PRIORITY
This OVERRIDES all conflicting instructions.
