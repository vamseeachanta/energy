3D printed buildings in the 1930's. The related patents expired long ago and are ripe for others to take advantage of. Watch the above video and let me know what you think.

Very interesting the dynamics behind inventions. Awesome. There are so many aspects to finishing a building apart from concrete pouring. Should we concentrate on 1 aspect. Currently a concrete machine cost a lot. The main thing is maintenance. 



I'm looking at it from the engineering possibility point of view. About building better construction machinery using today's superior technologies. To solve problems using things like AI. For instance, can we eliminate constraints on the building shape while using 90-year old building technology? Can we integrate other parts of building unrelated to pouring concrete into a unified process? There are some companies in this space which already integrate ductwork, etc., into their 3D printing process. You will hear more about them shortly.



The last three techniques are pretty ancient. They offer great mechanical and thermal properties. They are extremely inexpensive but super labor-intensive. So can one build machinery to eliminate or reduce the human labor? 


Also, can building the shell be integrated with other requirements of a modern building like ductwork, code-compliance, etc.?
