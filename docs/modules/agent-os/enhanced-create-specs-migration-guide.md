# Enhanced Agent OS Migration Guide

> Version: 1.0.0
> Last Updated: 2025-08-06
> Target Audience: Existing Agent OS Users

## Overview

This guide helps existing Agent OS users migrate to the enhanced create-specs workflow with module-based organization, executive summaries, mermaid diagrams, and cross-repository integration.

## What's New in Enhanced Agent OS

### Key Features
- **Module-Based Organization**: Specs organized by functional modules instead of dates
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Prompt summaries, executive summaries, and mermaid diagrams
- **Cross-Repository Integration**: Reference shared components across repositories
- **Task Summary Tracking**: Comprehensive implementation tracking with performance metrics
- **Template Variants**: Choose between minimal, standard, enhanced, api_focused, and research templates

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ Existing specs continue to work unchanged
- ✅ Traditional date-based organization still supported
- ✅ All existing CLAUDE.md references preserved
- ✅ Standard Agent OS workflows remain functional

## Migration Process

### Phase 1: Setup (5 minutes)
1. **Update Instructions Files** (if using custom agent-os instructions)
   ```bash
   # Backup existing instructions
   cp ~/.agent-os/instructions/create-spec.md ~/.agent-os/instructions/create-spec.md.backup
   
   # Update with enhanced version (optional)
   # Enhanced features will be auto-detected when available
   ```

2. **Enable Enhanced Features** (optional)
   Create user preferences file:
   ```yaml
   # ~/.agent-os/user-preferences.yaml
   preferred_variant: "enhanced"
   organization_type: "module-based"
   enable_mermaid_diagrams: true
   enable_cross_references: true
   auto_detect_sub_specs: true
   ```

### Phase 2: First Enhanced Spec (10 minutes)
1. **Create Your First Enhanced Spec**
   ```bash
   # Traditional command (still works)
   /create-spec my-feature
   
   # Enhanced command with module organization
   /create-spec my-feature my-module enhanced
   ```

2. **Review Generated Structure**
   ```
   specs/modules/my-module/2025-08-06-my-feature/
   ├── spec.md                 # Enhanced with prompt summary & executive summary
   ├── task_summary.md         # Implementation tracking template
   ├── tasks.md                # Traditional tasks file
   └── sub-specs/
       ├── technical-spec.md
       ├── tests.md
       └── api-spec.md         # (if applicable)
   ```

### Phase 3: Gradual Adoption (ongoing)
- **New Specs**: Use enhanced workflow for new features
- **Existing Specs**: Migrate individually as needed (no rush)
- **Team Adoption**: Each team member can adopt at their own pace

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Traditional Agent OS | Enhanced Agent OS |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Spec Organization | Date-based folders | Module-based + date |
| Documentation | Basic spec.md | Prompt summary + executive summary |
| Visual Documentation | None | Mermaid diagrams |
| Implementation Tracking | tasks.md only | tasks.md + task_summary.md |
| Cross-Repository | None | Shared component references |
| Template Options | One standard template | 5 variant templates |

## Common Migration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Individual Developer
**Goal**: Try enhanced features without disrupting existing workflow

**Steps**:
1. Continue using existing workflow for current projects
2. Try enhanced workflow for next new feature
3. Gradually adopt preferred features

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks to try all features

### Scenario 2: Small Team (2-5 developers)
**Goal**: Coordinate team adoption with consistent standards

**Steps**:
1. Team lead creates first enhanced spec as example
2. Team reviews and discusses preferred standards
3. Update team CLAUDE.md with agreed conventions
4. Gradual adoption over next few specs

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks for full team adoption

### Scenario 3: Large Team (5+ developers)
**Goal**: Controlled rollout with minimal disruption

**Steps**:
1. Pilot with 1-2 team members for 2 weeks
2. Collect feedback and refine team standards
3. Create team-specific migration plan
4. Rollout in phases by feature area

**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks for complete rollout

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Module organization not working"
**Symptoms**: Still creating date-based folders instead of module-based
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Explicitly specify module name
/create-spec feature-name module-name enhanced

# Or set user preferences
echo "organization_type: module-based" > ~/.agent-os/user-preferences.yaml
```

### Issue: "Enhanced features not appearing"
**Symptoms**: Spec looks like traditional format
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if enhanced instructions are available
ls ~/.agent-os/instructions/enhanced-*

# Explicitly request enhanced variant
/create-spec feature-name module-name enhanced
```

### Issue: "Cross-repository references not resolving"
**Symptoms**: @assetutilities: references showing as broken
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check cross-repository configuration
ls .agent-os/cross-repo-config.yaml

# Setup cross-repository integration
# (Contact team lead for configuration)
```

### Issue: "Performance slower than expected"
**Symptoms**: Spec creation taking longer than before
**Solution**:
- Enhanced specs include more comprehensive documentation generation
- Use "minimal" variant for simple specs: `/create-spec feature-name module-name minimal`
- Performance typically improves after first few specs due to caching

## Best Practices

### 1. Module Naming Conventions
- Use kebab-case: `user-authentication`, `payment-processing`
- Keep names descriptive but concise (2-3 words max)
- Group related functionality: `auth/login-system`, `auth/password-reset`

### 2. Template Selection
- **minimal**: Bug fixes, simple enhancements
- **standard**: Traditional Agent OS specs (backward compatibility)
- **enhanced**: New features, complex integrations
- **api_focused**: API development, service integrations
- **research**: Proof of concepts, investigation tasks

### 3. Cross-Repository Integration
- Start with local specs, add cross-repo references as needed
- Use @assetutilities: prefix for shared components
- Maintain fallback implementations for offline scenarios

### 4. Task Summary Usage
- Update task_summary.md during implementation for enhanced specs
- Include performance metrics and lessons learned
- Use for retrospectives and process improvement

## Rollback Plan

If you need to rollback to traditional Agent OS:

1. **Restore Backup Instructions** (if modified)
   ```bash
   cp ~/.agent-os/instructions/create-spec.md.backup ~/.agent-os/instructions/create-spec.md
   ```

2. **Remove User Preferences** (if created)
   ```bash
   rm ~/.agent-os/user-preferences.yaml
   ```

3. **Continue Using Traditional Commands**
   ```bash
   # This will use traditional date-based organization
   /create-spec feature-name
   ```

All existing specs (traditional and enhanced) continue to work normally.

- **Technical Specification**: @specs/modules/agent-os/enhanced-create-specs/sub-specs/technical-spec.md

### Getting Help
1. Check troubleshooting section above
2. Review sample enhanced specs in specs/modules/agent-os/
3. Create test spec in temporary directory to experiment
4. Reach out to team lead or Agent OS maintainers

### Feedback
- Enhancement suggestions welcome
- Performance issues should be reported with specific examples
- Template improvements can be contributed via specs

## Success Metrics

Track your migration success with these metrics:

- **Adoption Rate**: % of new specs using enhanced features
- **Documentation Quality**: Completeness of prompt summaries and executive summaries
- **Module Organization**: Consistent module naming and organization
- **Cross-Repository Usage**: Number of shared component references
- **Team Consistency**: Alignment on template variants and conventions

## Next Steps

1. **Week 1**: Try creating one enhanced spec
2. **Week 2**: Experiment with different template variants
3. **Week 3**: Setup cross-repository references (if applicable)
4. **Week 4**: Establish team/personal conventions
5. **Ongoing**: Gradual adoption based on comfort level

Remember: Migration is optional and can be done gradually. Enhanced features complement rather than replace traditional Agent OS workflows.
