# Azure Service Bus

Azure Functions is a serverless solution that allows you to write less code, maintain less infrastructure, and save on costs. Instead of worrying about deploying and maintaining servers, the cloud infrastructure provides all the up-to-date resources needed to keep your applications running.

You focus on the pieces of code that matter most to you, and Azure Functions handles the rest.
