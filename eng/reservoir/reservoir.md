The Reservoir engineer’s versus Process engineer’s perspective! The same fluid, very likely the same EoS, but negligible technical overlap. Why? Partly from our technical domains silo culture but also from pursuing different objectives.

Reservoir engineers focus on optimizing hydrocarbon recovery; how to produce the most barrels per buck. They want to predict how much oil and gas can be delivered and when.

Process engineers design plants that can be safely started and stopped, treat impurities and generate export streams such as a dewpointed gas, a stable liquid and LPG.

For simple reservoirs there is often no modelling overlap at all! Curiously overlap subsurface and surface modelling does become important for allocation. When multiple reservoirs with different owners share a single processing hub, the question of who owns which export barrel is of great interest. With feeds of different oils of different densities and condensates with changing compositions during depletion, modelling the commingled export streams can be challenging. A good fluid model that works across reservoir and surface domains can solve the problem. Petrophase has published a case study where allocation was determined with great accuracy, for a copy details contact me.
