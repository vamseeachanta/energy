What is the Bourdet derivative? ☟

🔍 The Bourdet derivative is widely used for identifying flow regimes in well testing (PTA). 💧

🔄 It has also shown utility in RTA (Rate Transient Analysis). 📈

📊 The Bourdet approach is illustrated in the chart below. 📉

🔍 Bourdet uses a constant log-cycle window before and after the point of derivation. ⏮️⏭️

🔍📉 The window-size, L, can be changed to smooth the data. 🌊📈

🌊📈 Since every point will not perfectly align with the log-cycle window, you have to find the closest point in each iteration.

🔍📏 It has huge benefits when working with noisy, high-frequency data.

💡 It's fundamentally different from a weighted central difference which uses a constant step size before and after the point of derivation. 🔀📏

⏰ Thanks to Behnam, GAURAV P.Eng., Hossein and others for teaching me this the last 6 months!

✔️ And thanks to Behnam for providing the Bourdet algorithm we use in whitson+! 👏
