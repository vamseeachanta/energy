Verification of the turbine positions was done by visual interpretation using high-resolution aerial imagery in ESRI ArcGIS Desktop. A locational error of plus or minus 10 meters for turbine locations was tolerated. Technical specifications for turbines were assigned based on the wind turbine make and models as provided by manufacturers and project developers directly, and via FAA datasets, information on the wind project developer or turbine manufacturer websites, or other online sources. Some facility and turbine information on make and model did not exist or was difficult to obtain. Thus, uncertainty may exist for certain turbine specifications. Similarly, some turbines were not yet built, not built at all, or for other reasons cannot be verified visually. Location and turbine specifications data quality are rated and a confidence is recorded for both. None of the data are field verified.<\u002fp>\n\n<p>The current version is available for download at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5e999f7982ce172707f6fd26\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(31, 117, 204); text-decoration-line: underline; outline: 0px; padding: 0px 2px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" title=\"United States Wind Turbine Database - Current Version (ver. 3.0)\">United States Wind Turbine Database - Current Version (ver. 3.1)<\u002fa>.<\u002fp>\n\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/viewer/\" style=\"padding: 0px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;\" title=\"https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/viewer/\">USWTDB Viewer<\u002fa>, created by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/energy-and-minerals/energy-resources-program\" style=\"padding: 0px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;\" title=\"https://www.usgs.gov/energy-and-minerals/energy-resources-program\">USGS Energy Resources Program<\u002fa>, lets you visualize, inspect, interact, and download the most current USWTDB version only, through a dynamic web application.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/viewer/\" style=\"padding: 0px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;\">https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/viewer/<\u002fa><\u002fp>\n","citation":"Hoen, B.D., Diffendorfer, J.E., Rand, J.T., Kramer, L.A., Garrity, C.P., and Hunt, H.E., 2018, United States Wind Turbine Database (ver. 3.1, July 2020): U.S. Geological Survey, American Wind Energy Association, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory data release, https://doi.org/10.5066/F7TX3DN0.","purpose":"The purpose of this information is to provide a regularly updated, publicly available, spatially referenced, national dataset made up almost entirely of utility-scale wind turbine locations and their technical specifications. An appropriate use of the data would be for scientific analysis, research or for general interest for the public. Identification of turbines that have been retrofitted, repowered, decommissioned, and/or removed is a continual ongoing effort; thus, the dataset may contain turbines that were previously verified and subsequently removed.","rights":"Although this digital spatial database has been subjected to rigorous review and is substantially complete, it is released on the condition that neither the USGS, LBNL, AWEA nor the United States Government nor any agency thereof, nor any employees thereof, makes any warranty, expressed or implied, or assumes any legal liability or responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any information contained within the database.","provenance":{"annotation":"This \"United States Wind Turbine Database\" was created from cooperative agreement and collaboration between the USGS, LBNL, and AWEA to compile and release these data. Previous Onshore Industrial Wind Turbine Locations for the United States data releases (2013 and 2014), as noted in the associated item were not part of that agreement. This data has improved AWEA and LBNL information, which includes some technical specifications that are obtained directly from project developers and turbine manufacturers. The structure of the USWTDB data is slightly different, such as new attributes, renamed attributes, and the elimination of known removed turbines. Please see the metadata for descriptions and the change log for more details.","dataSource":"Input directly","dateCreated":"2016-08-24T20:03:27Z","lastUpdated":"2020-07-22T00:49:22Z"},"maintenanceUpdateFrequency":"Unknown","hasChildren":true,"parentId":"59cab03de4b017cf314094df","contacts":[{"name":"James E Diffendorfer","oldPartyId":2558,"type":"Point of Contact","contactType":"person","email":"jediffendorfer@usgs.gov","active":true,"jobTitle":"Research Ecologist","personalTitle":"Dr.","firstName":"James","middleName":"E","lastName":"Diffendorfer","organization":{"displayText":"Geosciences and Environmental Change Science Center"},"primaryLocation":{"name":"James E Diffendorfer/GEOG/USGS/DOI -
