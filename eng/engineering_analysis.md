## Objective

Engineering simulation analysis requires capturing the anticipated real-work phenomenon.

## Summary


## Physical Quantities

The typical physical quantities or properties used for QA are given in this subsection.

### Cables/Flexibles - Offshore Applications


#### Min or Max quantities
- Location of MBR along particular section length:
- Min and max at the location of critical response
- Occurrence time for  Min and max at the location of critical response

Example Locations of interest for these quantites can be 
     - Entire length
     - Example section lengths for structure of length L are: End A (0 to x ft), Mid-section (x to L-x ft), End B (x-L to L ft)

Example loading conditions: 
     - No Load (No wave, No current, System in neutral day-to-day  state)
     - With Vessel offset pre-condition (pre-condition such as vessel offset, No Wave, No Current)
     - With Current Only (No wave, or other pre-conditions such as vessel offset)
     - With Wave Only (No Current, or other pre-conditions such as vessel offset)
     - Example section lengths for structure of length L are: End A (0 to x ft), Mid-section (x to L-x ft), End B (x-L to L ft)

#### Along the structure
- MBR
- Torsion (and Rotation)
- End tension and bending (to check and confirm fixity)



### Risers - Offshore Applications

The following trends along the riser:
- Effective Tension
- X, Y, Z Rotations
- Torsion along riser

For all risers:
- Bottom tension (Tension at top of BOP, Top of Tree etc.)

For all rigid jumpers
- Bottom tension (Tension )
