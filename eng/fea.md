## Shutting Down
Beams have relatively high breakeven electricity prices, so it takes very high prices to offset the lost revenue
ESPs use a lot more power but also have a lot more inherent risk to shut-downs

Take into account the risk and signficant increase in the price point to even consider shutting down. We're not going to be close at all to the price that makes it worthwhile
