## Introduction





## Summary


Simulation software: Hisys (Aspentech); Unisim (?); Olga at a more global level

Simulate in a software -> PFDs (Process flow diagrams) -> PIDs -> equipment procurement, mechanical, civil,  electrical, thermodynamics and chemical aspects

Gasification/pyrolysis plant


Reactor

Pressure vessels, heat exchangers, pipings, valves etc.

# Tolling

A toll process can be defined as performing a specific service on the product of a client. 

Tolling Processing Services are defined as an agreement between a toller (manufacturer) and a company to process raw materials or near finished goods for a predetermined fee in exchange. This is also referred to as a “toll” or “tolling fee”.

# Hydrocarbon Processes

The key hydrocarbon processes that will 
- Hydrocarbon treating
  - Sour treatment i.e. remove H2S (desulfurization) and CO2 (Sweetening). Membranes for pilot plants
  - Mercury removal 
  - Amine process (Compact amine processes for offshore applications)
- Dehydration 
  - Glycol injection/dehydration system
  - Regeneration systems
  - solid dessicants
  - liquid dehydration
- Hydrocarbon recovery
  - Heat exchangers and refrigeration processes
  - J-T processes

# Equipment


general machinery, piping, pressure vessels, heat exchangers, storage tanks, instrumentation, and safety equipment

# Data Analysis



# Pilot project

Reactor:
 - Volume: 250 litre, 500 l, 1000 l
 - 1- 3 days process 250 l (Bio reactor)
 - 


# EPC projects

The key is the to get each component right from the process, electrical, covil, structural, instrementation point of view


Skid module (or) non-skid modules
Skid:
- 2-3 equipment (typically adjacent) is grouped together into a skid for easy manufacturing
- Self contained instrumentation, piping etc.
- Each skid shall have interface pipings for interconnection of skid to other skids
- TYpical large skid size for full scale plant: 8 ft by 32 ft by 10 ft (height)

Procurement: Typically done using datasheets (or) vendor supplied datasheet
