Gasification/pyrolysis plant


Reactor

Pressure vessels, heat exchangers, pipings, valves etc.


# Hydrocarbon Processes

The key hydrocarbon processes that will 
- Hydrocarbon treating
  - Sour treatment i.e. remove H2S (desulfurization) and CO2 (Sweetening) Membranes
  - Mercury removal 
  - Amine process (Compact amine processes for offshore applications)
- Dehydration 
  - Glycol injection/dehydration system
  - Regeneration systems
  - solid dessicants
  - liquid dehydration
- Hydrocarbon recovery
  - Heat exchangers and refrigeration processes
  - J-T processes
