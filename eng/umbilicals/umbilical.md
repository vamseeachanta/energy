Subsea Umbilical Installation Analysis

Subsea Umbilical's are laid using one of the following typical methods:

1- The umbilical is initiated at the manifold with a stab and hinge-over connection or a pull-in/connection method and terminated near the subsea well with a second end lay down sled (i.e., infield umbilical connection from manifold to satellite well). The connection between the umbilical and the subsea well is later made using a combination of the following tie-in methods: (1) rigid or a flexible jumper, (2) junction plates, and (3) flying leads.

2- The umbilical is initiated at the manifold with a stab and hinge-over
connection or a pull-in/connection method. It is laid in the direction to the fixed or floating production system and pulled through an I/J tube or cross-hauled from the laying vessel to the floating production vessel.

3- The umbilical can also be initiated at the fixed or floating production system and terminated near the subsea structure with a second end umbilical termination assembly (i.e., termination head, lay down sled, umbilical termination unit). A pull-in/connection tool operated by an ROV may be used to connect the umbilical to the subsea structure.

The objective of the umbilical installation analysis is to provide a step by-step analysis that can aid in the generation of the umbilical installation procedure. The analysis also provides the maximum allowable sea states, maximum expected loads, and guidelines for vessel offsets.

The analysis is performed in two stages: static analysis without any environmental loading on the model and dynamic analysis with environmental
loading such as current and wave. Dynamic analysis is performed by selecting
the worst cases (based on minimum bending radius and tension) from the
static analysis and then applying environmental loading such as current action,
wave action, peak period, and directionality to the model. The directions of wave and current may be conservatively assumed to be the same.

The design criteria for an umbilical installation are as follows:
• Minimum bending radius (MBR) of umbilical;
• Maximum allowable tension and compression loads;
• Maximum allowable crushing loads, which can be translated to check the maximum allowable top tension;
• Lateral stability on the seabed, which can be translated to check the
maximum allowable tension force of the touchdown point.
