Air temperature analysis is perforemd using the temperature data available to project from ASHRAE data, [1]. The closest temperature measurement stations and the associated temperature data is below:

| Location           | Distance to WLNG Facility | 5yr RP Min Temp | 10yr RP Min Temp | 20yr RP Min Temp |  50yr RP Min Temp |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| Squamish Airport, BC | 15 km NE | -12.1 | -13.2 | -14.3 | -15.7
| Callagen Valley, BC | 40 km N | -20 | -21.8 | -23.6 | -25.9
| Port Mellon, BC | 22 km S | -9.8 | -11.2 | -12.6 | -14.3

The key Conclusions are:
• Temperatures are taken at Squamish station, BC. See Reference [1] Due to the terrain (mountainous) and the location of the weather station, the air temperature is not representative of the air temperature at the FST site.
• Based on data available, the air temperature is  only available for 50yr return period (RP) while the design life is 25 years. To bring corollary for GoM designs a 20 year design life facility using 100yr RP as extreme condition and 1000yr RP survival condition. Data available is statistically limited.
• Extreme daily average air temperature data is required for the FST design per ABS design code,. However, only extreme temperature in a day is available in ASHRAE sources. Daily mean temperature is not available.
The Recommendations for the project are:
• Given the limited temperature data and the 25yr design life of the facility, for the FST and associated structural design, we conservatively recommend to use Grade B material per ABS.
• If not already done so, measure  of air temperature (using multiple stations) at the FST  location
• For long-term, recommend project to establish 100yr RP and 1000yr RP data for all environmental/metocean parameters (where missing) for the project.
