## Invisible Lost TIme

Seeing Invisible Lost Time (ILT) in Drilling Requires the Proper Lens – maximize opportunity
Invisible Lost Time is typically the largest time / cost reduction opportunity in oil and gas drilling which is often overlooked, neglected, or compromised. It is overlooked when drillers are unaware of it, neglected when drillers either choose or are driven to focus solely on NPT or compromised when the target used to calculate ILT causes the ILT to be minimized.

ILT can be defined as the difference between normally planned operational duration and a best practice target. It is invisible because it does not appear as lost time in the plan or on any conventional morning reports. When addressed in planning and execution its reduction can significantly improve drilling performance (reduce drilling durations) sometimes as much as 50%.
The question to ask is “what is the target for calculating ILT?”. Often it is Technical Limit (TL) which is an estimate of the fastest duration a particular well with a particular drilling spread could be drilled if all operations progress flawlessly; made by a team of experts with experience drilling similar wells the same way and with reference to historic performance data. Unfortunately, TL is emotionally derived leading some teams to take a conservative approach to improve their chance of perceived / reported success.
A non-emotional means is to calculate the Maximum Theoretical Performance (MTP) and then address the gap between this aggressive (non-emotional) target and current practice. This gap is almost always larger than the gap to Technical Limit creating a greater opportunity to search for safe, risk managed performance improvements. The means to calculate this was first published by Ford Brett as the “Perfect Well” and then was adopted in an SPE paper I co-authored – SPE 178850 “True Lies: Measuring Drilling and Completion Efficiency”.
A few examples of opportunities to reduce ILT include:
-       Remove activities from the critical path – e.g. nipple up BOP’s.
-       Pre-make BHA’s either in the shop or in a bucking unit on site (on or offshore).
-       Remove planned inefficiencies – extra wiper trip at connections because it was historical practice and now serves no purpose.
-       Minimizing number of bit runs (economically).
-       Fully prepare for all critical path activities before the activities commence.
-       Changing mud type and / or properties.
-       Twin mud systems to minimize changeover time.
-       …………………………….
Each such opportunity requires proper preparation by the planning and execution team such that these reduced critical path activities do not reappear as Non-Productive Time.
I am interested to read more examples of deriving the target for ILT reduction and examples of changed activities that reduced ILT.
