## Introduction



## Summary



Although torque and drag are usually problematical features of the drilling process, they can also be used as downhole indicators of hole condition. During drilling, monitoring torque and drag is a method for optimising drilling performance and may provide indications of other potential problems such as:
·     Differential Sticking
·     Key Seating
·     Poor Hole Cleaning
·     Hole Instability
·     Ledging

Factors Which Affect Torque and Drag
 
The main influences on torque and drag are:
·        The wall force
·        The nature of the surfaces in contact (e.g. type and roughness)
·        Mud lubricity
·        Wellbore stability
·        Hole cleaning

## Invisible Lost TIme (John de Wardt)

Seeing Invisible Lost Time (ILT) in Drilling Requires the Proper Lens – maximize opportunity
Invisible Lost Time is typically the largest time / cost reduction opportunity in oil and gas drilling which is often overlooked, neglected, or compromised. It is overlooked when drillers are unaware of it, neglected when drillers either choose or are driven to focus solely on NPT or compromised when the target used to calculate ILT causes the ILT to be minimized.

ILT can be defined as the difference between normally planned operational duration and a best practice target. It is invisible because it does not appear as lost time in the plan or on any conventional morning reports. When addressed in planning and execution its reduction can significantly improve drilling performance (reduce drilling durations) sometimes as much as 50%.
The question to ask is “what is the target for calculating ILT?”. Often it is Technical Limit (TL) which is an estimate of the fastest duration a particular well with a particular drilling spread could be drilled if all operations progress flawlessly; made by a team of experts with experience drilling similar wells the same way and with reference to historic performance data. Unfortunately, TL is emotionally derived leading some teams to take a conservative approach to improve their chance of perceived / reported success.
A non-emotional means is to calculate the Maximum Theoretical Performance (MTP) and then address the gap between this aggressive (non-emotional) target and current practice. This gap is almost always larger than the gap to Technical Limit creating a greater opportunity to search for safe, risk managed performance improvements. The means to calculate this was first published by Ford Brett as the “Perfect Well” and then was adopted in an SPE paper I co-authored – SPE 178850 “True Lies: Measuring Drilling and Completion Efficiency”.
A few examples of opportunities to reduce ILT include:
-       Remove activities from the critical path – e.g. nipple up BOP’s.
-       Pre-make BHA’s either in the shop or in a bucking unit on site (on or offshore).
-       Remove planned inefficiencies – extra wiper trip at connections because it was historical practice and now serves no purpose.
-       Minimizing number of bit runs (economically).
-       Fully prepare for all critical path activities before the activities commence.
-       Changing mud type and / or properties.
-       Twin mud systems to minimize changeover time.
-       …………………………….
Each such opportunity requires proper preparation by the planning and execution team such that these reduced critical path activities do not reappear as Non-Productive Time.
I am interested to read more examples of deriving the target for ILT reduction and examples of changed activities that reduced ILT.


## NPT (John de Wardt)


Is Drilling Non-Productive Time Percentage (%NPT) a Misleading Performance Indicator?
Percentage NPT can mislead on the overall performance of drilling and completing an oil and gas well. Peter Rushmore published an article some years ago on the fallacy of NPT as a percentage and recommended measuring NPT per 1,000m (or 3,000 ft). He contributed this view to an SPE / IADC paper we co-authored with Phil Scott in 2016 titled: True Lies: Measuring Drilling and Completion Efficiency SPE 178850.

Almost all operators use percentage Non-Productive Time (NPT) as a measure of efficiency, considering that a well drilled with a low % NPT represents a “better” performance than a well with a high % NPT. This, however, is not necessarily true. Two identical wells drilled incurring similar events creating 10 days NPT where the first well took 100 days in total resulting in 10% NPT and the second was drilled more aggressively in just 50 days, resulting in 20% NPT. The 20% NPT well represents the better overall drilling performance despite the higher % NPT figure. 

The issue, of course, is would both identical wells incur similar NPT in terms of duration of NPT. That is a challenging question since some NPT is related to drilled formations and other depth related issues while some NPT is related to the stress on machinery and the duration of usage. The depth related issues would presumably occur similarly in each well while the machinery stress and time related issues could be different. Often a well that is drilled faster is stressing the machinery more than one drilled slowly while conversely creating less exposure to the time related sources. 

As has been argued, % NPT is not a valid measure of performance or efficiency because both the numerator and denominator in the calculation can change independently of each other for a given well. A guaranteed way to reduce % NPT is simply to drill more slowly thus increasing well cost and delaying hydrocarbon production. There are stories in the industry of % NPT incentive schemes driving very cautious drilling to reduce the % NPT incurred lowering the overall performance and increasing well cost

Peter pointed out that the problem of the numerator and denominator both changing can be solved by reporting NPT in terms of ‘per foot / meter’ in the same way that drilling speed is often reported as ‘Days per foot / meter’. As the length of a foot / meter does not change a low ‘NPT days per foot / meter’ will always represent a better performance than a higher ‘NPT days per foot / meter’. In the example above, the NPT in ‘Days per foot / meter’ will be the same for those identical wells.

I am interested to read thoughts, comments and experience with this interesting topic.
