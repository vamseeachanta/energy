## Introduction





## Summary


Although torque and drag are usually problematical features of the drilling process, they can also be used as downhole indicators of hole condition. During drilling, monitoring torque and drag is a method for optimising drilling performance and may provide indications of other potential problems such as:
·     Differential Sticking
·     Key Seating
·     Poor Hole Cleaning
·     Hole Instability
·     Ledging

Factors Which Affect Torque and Drag
 
The main influences on torque and drag are:
·        The wall force
·        The nature of the surfaces in contact (e.g. type and roughness)
·        Mud lubricity
·        Wellbore stability
·        Hole cleaning
