Lugs are generally pin loaded attachment structures capable of carrying tremendous amount of load and often made of aluminum alloys (Figure 1). As a result they are very heavy and have the potential to be optimized as a lightweighting exercise.

They are extensively used in main landing gear fittings, fuselage to wing connection, tail plane to fuselage connection, linkage of high lift systems or the main rotor head of a helicopter (see Figure 2).

This connector-type structure has been responsible for several incidences, including the crash of AA587 in November 2001. During operation, a lug joint will experience significant fatigue loads and environment variations.

The current design of lug structures is based on semi-empirical (experimental-analytical) guidelines considering the loading scenario as in Figure 1. The guidelines such as those outlined in ESDU 91008 are specifically for metallic lugs with no consideration to Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers (CFRP).

On the other hand, in the past decade there has been a growing use of CFRP for aerospace applications (see previous posts). With CFRP comes challenging field of application that need to be addressed such as composite lugs (see Figure 3).

Use of CFRP for lug structure is challenging. Locally concentrated load is introduced into the composite structure and causes a complex 3D stress state. High load levels, which are characteristic for aircraft structures and limited design space can result in small edge distances and thick laminates (> 30 mm thick). The design of these load introductions is mainly based on experience and considerable testing [2].

To qualify composite lugs for further applications in aerostructures, design guidelines are needed. In contrast to classical applications of composite materials in thin-walled structures ( a plane stress state), the out-of-plane components of the stress tensor exist and may trigger failure in thick laminates due to low strength in thickness direction [2].

Design guidelines need to consider this type of failure and therefore out-of-plane design allowables are required. Failure under out-of-plane loading conditions in thick laminates usually occurs in the form of delaminations. This is due to manufacturing imperfections or micromechanical stress concentrations at crossings of fibres or yarns within the interface of adjacent layers.

To characterize the initiation of delaminations by a suitable failure criterion, the through-thickness failure loads under pure tensile, pure shear and mixed-mode loading (tension-shear) conditions have to be determined [2].

To date, there are no existing standards for the determination of through-thickness design allowables for CFRP. Thus, there is a great need for the development of further test methods and specimens.

Given the above (particularly gap in knowledge), the use of CFRP material in lug structure and its notable weight saving benefits has not received the attention it deserves.
