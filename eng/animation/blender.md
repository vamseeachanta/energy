# Introduction

FreeCAD is a computer aided design (CAD) software. The capabilities are:

## Summary



### Workflows

Trying to create the best workflow is a challenge as tasks overlap among various softwares.

- Start with 3D CAD tool and then export STP file to blender if:
    - Accurate design and detailed drawings are required
    - An existing design already exists
- Start with blender if: 
    - Validity (and not accuracy) is the objective of the design


### Blender Capabilities

The high-level capabilities of blender are:
- Rendering
- Modeling and Sculpting
- Animation and Rigging
- Story artistry
- VFX
- Simulation
- Pipeline
- Video editing
- Scripting (Python API)
- Interface (UI, Window layout etc.)


Some detailed level capabilities of blender for mechanical engineering are:
- Blender can create technical drawings for your models i.e. It allows for 2D orthographic views and measurements of your objects within the viewport.
- Design and create models to 10th of mm.

#### Blender for Engineers

[Blender for Engineers](https://www.skillshare.com/en/classes/Blender-for-Engineers-step-by-step-Guide/1343651764) course work consists of the following learnings:
- you will learn how to import cad files in blender
- how to make animation using free cad models
- how to render step files in blender
- how to make mechanical drawings
- optimize your models for 3d printing

A usecase of [blender for large scale projects](https://blendergrid.com/learn/articles/tyler-disney-interview) where visualizations are performed using blender  by importing CAD drawings from revit (.fbx format).
