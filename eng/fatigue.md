## Introduction


## Summary




## Weld Size
Is the weld size affects the vulnerability of Socket weld joint to fatigue failure?
 
For Small Bore Piping (SBP) Socket weld fittings, Longer weld legs along the pipe side of the weld increases its predicted fatigue resistance.
 
Check this EPRI report showing the results of vibration fatigue testing of socket welds and explores the effect of other factors (PWHT, material, weld qaulity, weld toe conditions).
In addition, it discusses the possibility to overlay existing socket welds to enhance the weld strength and its fatigue resistance.
