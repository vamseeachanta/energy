Today, I had the privilege of moderating a panel discussion on "Innovations for Improved LWI Control Systems" at the 9th Annual Offshore Well Intervention for Gulf of Mexico Conference. Joined by esteemed panel members Scott Sanantonio (Shell), Matt Lewis (TechnipFMC), Matt Vick (BP), and Hans Kros (CalTex Oil Tools), we engaged in a comprehensive exploration of the robust benefits and intricate challenges associated with Traditional IWOCS, MUX Systems, and Remote Electrical Systems and how we support the industry with acceptance of new technology. Our collective focus was on elucidating how we contribute to industry advancement through the adoption of innovative technologies. Grateful to the panel team for leading a stimulating dialogue that delved into the forefront of advancements in our industry. Your insights and expertise contribute immensely to the pursuit of excellence in offshore well intervention.
