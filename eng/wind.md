### Foundations

For the next generation 15-20 MW wind turbine with the water depth between 30-60 meter, a XXXL monopile weighing 3000 - 3500 mt could be expected.

Due to the vessel motions, the boom angles, and other dynamic risks, a 5000 mt crane would be considered too risky to lift and to install a XXXL monopile. This would eliminate most vessel options except the 4 largest derrick barges in the world according to the data we compiled.  

Meanwhile, a well-designed jacket structure would weigh only 50%-60% of a XXXL monopile because of the structural optimization using a structural system instead of using a tubular member. More derrick barges would be available for the jacket installation.  

One can do a relative straight forward cost analysis to compare the cost of using a XXXL monopile versus a jacket by adding up the fabrication cost and the vessel cost. The vessel cost of a XXXL monopile would clearly deteriorate its cost advantage over a jacket’s.

However, what a simple cost analysis cannot tell you is the pile driving refusal risk.

1) If a XXXL monopile experiences refusal, the salvage effort would be huge, costly, and time-consuming. Excessive hammering, soil excavation, water jetting, and other measures would require additional engineering, equipment, logistics, and preparation. If the refusal mitigation is not well planned or executed, the additional vessel time would quickly balloon to an unacceptable level from the commercial perspective.

2) If a suction bucket jacket experiences non-penetration, the mitigations could be higher suction pressure, additional weight to help penetration, rotated the jacket’s orientation, slightly shift the location, etc. Non-penetration is unlikely because a suction bucket length is generally less than 15 meters.

3) For a pin-pile-based jacket installed by an experienced contractor, refusals are not expected and even if it happened, the jacket’s 75 years of lessons learned should help to result the situation relatively quickly.
