Subsea Structure Installation Analysis
The subsea structure installation procedure normally includes the following:
• Load-out and sea-fastening;
• Transportation;
• Site survey;
• Deployment, typically including overboarding, splash zone lowering, midwater lowering, landing, and positioning and setting ;
• As-built survey.
This section describe only the structure deployment analysis, which may be the most critical analysis for subsea installation, while other analyses such as barge strength verification for transportation and lifting analysis for loadout, are not included in this section.
Analysis of subsea structure deployment provides the maximum allowable sea states and maximum expected cable tensions and the motions of installed equipment during installation. Finite element software (e.g., Orcaflex) is used for the installation analysis. The objective of the detailed installation analysis is to provide a step-by-step analysis to aid in the generation of the equipment deployment procedure.
The installation analysis can be divided into two stages: static analysis
without any environmental loading, and dynamic analysis with environmental loading such as current and wave. The static analysis determines the relationship between vessel position, wire payouts, and tensions for the system in a static state. The dynamic analysis is performed for the system under environmental loads in order to determine the maximum allowable installation sea states and the maximum tension required. The analyses are carried out for a range of wave heights and wave periods.
Figure below illustrates the installation procedures for a typical subsea structure with the forces modeled during each step.
