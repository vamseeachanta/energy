## Spreader Bar

COG is vital for any lifting operations, and a spreader bar is used to create a stable and even weight distribution while lifting heavy loads. It helps prevent the load from tilting or swinging, ensuring safer and more efficient lifting. The spreader bar typically has multiple attachment points for lifting equipment like cranes or hoists, allowing for a balanced lift and reducing the risk of damage to the load and surrounding environment.
