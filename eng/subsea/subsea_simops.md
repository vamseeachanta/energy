Subsea SIMOP

Simultaneous Operations (SIMOPS) is the execution of two or more tasks by two or more functional teams on a similar location at the same time.
Subsea SIMOP occurs when two vessels (MPCV - DSV - etc.) are working on the same areas carrying out intervention activities by ROVs or divers.
While conducting SIMOPS study, with every hazard having its own risk, additional risks are generated thanks to coincidental execution within the same space. In order to spot potential hazards and to eliminate, minimize or manage the chance related to SIMOPS, dedicated risk assessment method shall be followed in situ involving all stakeholders.
SIMOPS is a conflict of activities that could bring an set of undesired event or circumstances. (i.e. safety, environment or financial). SIMOPS reviews play a vital role in performance of (HAZOP) studies.
SIMOPS occurred during expansion or critical maintenance work within the process area of existing facility.

SIMOPS is a conflict of activities that could bring an set of undesired event or circumstances. (i.e. safety, environment or financial). SIMOPS reviews play a vital role in performance of (HAZOP) studies.
SIMOPS can be offshore, (i.e. subsea oil and gas production), or onshore, (i.e. oil and gas marine terminals) during expansion or critical maintenance work within the process area of existing facility.

Team Members: The members that are part of each task operation. They should follow the task supervisor instructions, and be briefed prior task/operation initiation. Pre-request items such as, PPE use, Experience / training, and fatigue management should be applied to team members prior task/operation.
Actions required
Ship managers should provide clear guidance for combined operations and an effective SIMOPS risk assessment procedure to be in place in order to enhance safety onboard vessel or offshore units. A step by step thinking procedure should be followed as a guide to safe execution of combined operations.
