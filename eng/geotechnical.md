A soil report is the technical basis for all the subsequent engineering. Insufficient data points or quality concerns of the geotechnical investigations would greatly affect a project. On the other hand, the design team is also important - over conservatism, not knowing constructability & installability, and didn’t try to optimize the weight would greatly increase the project cost.

Jan De Nul was awarded WTG foundation EPCI scopes for three OWFs in the Taiwan Strait. The first project, Formosa I phase II, monopiles were selected with vibrational tool to mitigation the pile slip risks. Despite the successful monopile installation experience, Jan De Nul's adopted jacket foundations for the consecutive Taipower I and Formosa II OWFs based on their client's engineering considerations of the soil risks. Similarly, for Orsted and CIP’s projects in Taiwan, after their engineering studies, they came to the same conclusion that jacket foundation would be the solution for their sites.  

wpd’s monopile decision on Yunlin and Guanyin OWFs was the only outlier. wpd did not go for the turn-key solution like Formosa I, II and Taipower I. Neither did Yunlin hired the best geotechnical surveyor Fugro or the renowned engineering company Ramboll to help them on their foundation designs.  

Here are my ideas of the main causes for Yunlin misfortune.  
It is the contracting strategy that determines the destiny of the project.
It is when you rush into the project and you don’t think the high quality geotechnical/geophysical investigations worth the extra money.
It is when your engineering contractor came out of the world’s largest monopile in a 7-35m water depth site and you didn’t see a problem with it.
It is when all other developers decide to use jacket foundations, a not so common foundation type at that time, for some important reasons, and you did not question yourself “did we miss something here??”
It is when you came out of the world’s largest monopiles at that time and you did not choose the tier-one contractor to mitigate the “first of its kind” risk.
It is when you are under the time pressure and you are still obsessed with the cost savings and corner cuttings that jeopardized any chance of any turnaround and exacerbated the chaos.
It is the wishful thinking that things will solve by themselves that the natural laws repeat a second pile run.
It is the incapability of making offshore installation plan and the lack of back-up plans that resulting the firefighting chaos and ad-hoc costly decisions.
It is all of the above (and more) that contribute to this project’s dismal situation. It is the optimistic ignorance, the mindset, the lack of experience, the baseless confidence, the dysfunctions of priority setting, and the contracting strategy.
