## Introduction

Waiting on weather is a common phenomenon in offshore.

This needs a great deal of planning and coordination. Also, the uncertainties are high. To help prepare for this,

A monte carlo simulation can be used to determine the most optimum wait on weather time eastimates for a given project. This will help minimize the overall bid cost and also help maximize the chane of winning the bid.

## Summary

Known weather statics -> 10,000 + simulations of wave trains using monte carlo method -> determine the optimum wait on weather time.
